* Dynamic Programming Methods
** Definetions go here:
Dynamic  Programming has two techniques
Bottom-Up -> Memorization 
Top-Down ->Tabulation
** Algos 
*** Finding a sqaure-submatrix with all 1's inside a given matrix
s[i][j] is the size of the matrix with all 1's such that M[i][j] is the rightmost bottom corner of the given matrix 
then 
if(M[i][j]==1)
s[i][j] = min(s[i-1][j], s[i-1][j-1], s[i][j-1])+1
else
s[i][j]=0

*** Fibonaci Number Methods
**** Method - 1 Recursion
***** Time Complexity O(T(n) = T(n-1)+T(n-2))
***** Space Complexity O(n) if the stack is considered O(1) Else
**** Method - 2 Dynamic Programming
***** Time O(n)
***** Space O(n)
**** Method - 3 Space Optmizied method (for loop without array)
***** Time O(n)
***** Space O(1)
**** Method - 4 Use of Power Matrix
(1 1; 1 0)^n = (F_n+1 F_n; F_n F_n-1)
***** Time O(log(n))
***** Space O(1)
